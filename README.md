- **Professional Background Styles:**

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or newer
- `pip` (Python's package installer)

### 1. Get the Code
Download the project files and place them in a single project folder. Your folder should contain:
- `qr_code_app.py`
- `qrcodegen.py`
- `requirements.txt`

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep project dependencies isolated.

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
# Create a virtual environment named '.venv'
python -m venv .venv
